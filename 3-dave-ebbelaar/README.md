# Introduction

This article contains a structured learning path with steps for learning AI from basic to advanced level.

## 1. [How Dave Would Learn AI in 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2FDq3agImI&t=10s)
In this video, Dave provides 7 steps to correctly learn AI from zero in the early stage of AI revolution.
He starts by discussing some misconceptions around AI, e.g. 
- all the hypes surrounding AI, like a lot of videos about using no-code/low-code tools to create AI and automation;
but learning AI in depths requires coding
- AI has been around since 1950s, but now it's all about the ChatGPT hype; it's important to understand AI as umbrella term

Dave's channel focuses on learning by doing/reverse-engineering.

The 7 steps:
1. Setup Work Environment: Python and its virtual environment (I'd suggest to use uv)
2. Learn Python Basics & data related libraries: Pandas, numpy
3. Learn Git and GitHub Basics
4. Work on Projects & Build Portfolio: reverse engineer existing projects and explore different AI areas,
also see Kaggle & ProjectPro
5. Pick Specialisation & Share Knowledge
6. Continue Learning & Upskill: for data professionals, learning software engineering skills is essential
7. Monetise Skills

## 2. [Dave's 7 Lessons for New AI Engineers - A Beginner's Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IycFShi7J80&t=333s)
### Lesson 1: Building Applications
Start with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) because it helps with combatting training cutoff and reduces hallucination.
### Lesson 2: Data Privacy
Ensure that your data is not used for training the LLM.
### Lesson 3: Adapting Rapidly
Because AI field is constantly changing and new frameworks may be available every week.
### Lesson 4: Still About the Data
Quality data in = quality data out.
### Lesson 5: Start with Proof of Concept (PoC)
Start small, such as PoC with a duration of 4-6 weeks, and constantly gather feedback.
### Lesson 6: PoC to Production Transition
LLMs are non-deterministic; so need a framework to monitor and evaluate your apps.
### Lesson 7: Required Skills
Improve software engineering skills, but keep a data science mindset because AI app is non-determeinistic.
