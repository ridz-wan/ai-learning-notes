# My AI Learning Journey

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my AI learning notes, insights, and practical implementations. As I transition from Data Analysis to AI Engineering, I've documented my learning process to create a valuable resource for fellow data professionals and AI enthusiasts embarking on similar journeys.

## About Me

Hi there! I'm Ridwan, a passionate Data Analyst with expert domain knowledge in ecommerce logistics. I love working with Python and am currently on an exciting journey to become an AI Engineer. I'm always excited to learn new things in this ever-evolving tech world. My journey has taken me across different industries, which has taught me to be adaptable and always focus on creating solutions that truly serve users. I believe in the power of continuous learning and staying curious about emerging technologies!
